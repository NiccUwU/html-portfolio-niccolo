<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Niccolo Inocencio; I am 24 years old, and I am a Web Developer. I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in
  Fine Arts, majored in Painting, and now I am working on Web Development. As of 2023, I am still a student in this field, 
  and I am thoroughly enjoying it. I consider myself as a creative individual, and I also commit to a few other hobbies on the side. 
</p>

<p>What made me drawn to learning Web Development is the endless possibilities of creating something that people will love and 
  find useful. In the manner that Mark Zuckerberg achieved with Facebook, I find it fascinating to be able to change the world 
  by simply typing code in my computer, sitting in my bedroom. At the same time, I am enchanted by the process of wrinting code.
  I see it like digital Legos; each line of element and command is like a puzzle piece. You can stack and organize them in many
  different ways in order to create something new. As a creative, the idea of being able to build anything is alluring.
</p>

<p>I have a few other activities I like to do besides my coding and painting. I love learning new skills, watching movies, and
  staying in shape. One of the other skills I am working on right now is my Spanish. During my free time, I enjoy watching movies
  because they are a big part of modern culture, and I am always in awe of a good story. And finally, I like to work out because it
  sharpens my physical and my mental health. I believe that all these activities I do contibute to both my career, as well as in 
  shaping me to become a well-rounded person.
