<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>A mind bending suspense with a bone-chilling plot twist</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Batman and Joker; polar opposites both in character and in style, the perfect rivals; 
both trying to outsmart each other as friends and loved ones are caught in the crossfires of their battles</p>
<h3>Bo Burnham: Inside</h3>
<p>A relatable tragedy about the lonely living conditions in one of the most pivotal moments in recent history, 
the COVID-19 pandemic; all narrated in a mix of catchy music and toilet humor</p>
